- **Admit When You Don’t Know:**  
  - It’s okay to say, “I don’t know.”  
  - Admitting this shows honesty and encourages learning together.  
  - No one knows everything—especially in a fast-moving field like AI!

- **Be Interactive and Engaging:**  
  - Ask questions to the audience (“Who here has used AI before?”).  
  - Use relatable examples (e.g., “Imagine a chef using AI to create new recipes!”).  
  - Encourage participation—invite questions at any time.

- **Make It Accessible:**  
  - Avoid jargon; explain terms simply.  
  - Use analogies from everyday life (e.g., “AI is like a recipe book that learns new recipes over time.”).  
  - Share stories or fun facts about AI in different fields (cooking, art, sports, etc.).

- **Highlight AI’s Broad Appeal:**  
  - Emphasize that AI isn’t just for computer scientists—chefs, artists, students, and everyone can benefit.  
  - Give examples of AI in unexpected places (music, healthcare, education).

- **Foster Curiosity:**  
  - Encourage the audience to ask “why” and “how.”  
  - Remind them: curiosity is the first step to learning about AI.
