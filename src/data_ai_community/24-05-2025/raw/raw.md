Slide 1 – From APIs to MCP  
Welcome! I’m Bevan Venter. Thanks for joining this 20-minute sprint.

**Big idea:** MCP is like USB-C for AI—one simple plug that lets any model talk to any banking system.

Here’s the roadmap: Why integration hurts → What MCP is → How you can use it.

**Ground rule:** If something stumps me, I’ll happily say, “I don’t know—let’s find out together.”

Slide 2 – Why Integration Hurts Today  
Picture a tangle of cables: that’s what today’s finance APIs feel like.

Data silos block insight, weeks-long onboarding stalls customers, and fraud tools act too late.

Quick check—who here has ever waited weeks for a bank integration? (Raise your hand.)

Good news: we can clean up that mess.

---

Slide 3 – Meet MCP  
Model Context Protocol—MCP. Think of it as the standard handshake between AI and legacy cores.

Just like USB-C, it hides the ugly wiring and says, “Same plug, any device.”

One interface, fewer contracts, faster launches.

And it’s an open spec—not vendor lock-in.

---

Slide 4 – How MCP Works  
Step 1: Map the request—What data does the model need?

Step 2: Transform—Wrap that data into a common context package.

Step 3: Deliver—Send results straight back to the app in real time.

Three steps, one flow—easy to remember.

Slide 5 – Wins for Banks & FIs  
- Real-time data exchange: no more nightly batches.
- Faster onboarding & KYC: minutes, not weeks.
- Live fraud & CX insights: models flag risk while the card is still warm.

Which of these would move the needle most for your team? (Quick show of fingers: 1–3.)

Slide 6 – Fintechs in the Wild  
- Block shaved weeks off partner integrations by standardizing calls.
- Sardine plugs fraud AI into multiple banks through one doorway.

The pattern: open spec → faster launches → new revenue.

---

Slide 7 – Tomorrow’s Playbook  
Today: manual mapping, batch jobs, vendor lock-in.

Tomorrow with MCP: plug-and-play models, real-time orchestration, agile ecosystems.

Imagine rolling out a new AI feature in one week, not a quarter.

---

Slide 8 – Audience Mini-Exercise  
Turn to the person next to you. Where could MCP help your world—compliance, payments, customer care?

You have 30 seconds. Go!

(After time) Two volunteers—please share your idea in one sentence.

---

Slide 9 – Sell the Vision Internally  
Use clarity, brevity, and impact. Start with the pain, land on the win.

Frame it in threes: “Cost, Speed, Safety.”

When challenged, bridge: “Great point—here’s what we’re doing to mitigate…”

Remember: stories beat specs in the boardroom.

---

Slide 10 – Key Takeaways  
- MCP = universal AI plug.
- Interoperability unlocks speed and safety.
- You can start exploring today—the spec is public, pilots are welcome.

If you remember nothing else, remember the USB-C image.

Slide 11 – Q & A  
Fire away—ideas, worries, edge cases.

If I don’t know, I’ll say so and circle back after the session.

Let’s learn together.

Slide 12 – Thank You / Contact  
Thanks for your time and curiosity.

Let’s build the future of finance—connect on LinkedIn or grab me after the talk.

Safe travels and happy integrating!
